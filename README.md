Glossary
Branch: an independent line of development that diverges from the main project. It allows developers to work on new features or fixes without affecting the main codebase.
Clone: a copy of a remote Git repository on your local machine. This allows developers to work on the project locally while maintaining a connection to the original repository.
Commit: a saved snapshot of changes in a Git repository. It acts as a checkpoint that records what modifications were made, allowing developers to track progress and revert changes if needed.
Fetch: retrieves the latest changes from a remote repository without automatically merging them into the local branch. It allows developers to see updates before deciding to integrate them.
GIT: a distributed version control system that helps developers track changes, collaborate on code, and manage project history efficiently.
Github: a cloud-based platform for hosting Git repositories. It provides tools for version control, collaboration, and project management, making it easier for teams to work together on software development.
Merge: the process of combining changes from one branch into another, typically integrating feature branches into the main branch.
Merge Conflict: when Git cannot automatically combine changes from different branches because the same lines of code were modified in conflicting ways. Developers must manually resolve these conflicts before proceeding.
Push: sends local commits to a remote repository, updating the shared codebase with the latest changes.
Pull: Pulling fetches changes from a remote repository and merges them into the local branch, ensuring that the local code is up to date.
Remote: a version of a repository hosted on a server (e.g., GitHub, GitLab). It allows multiple developers to collaborate on the same project.
Repository: a storage location for a Git project, containing all the files, commit history, and branches necessary for development.
